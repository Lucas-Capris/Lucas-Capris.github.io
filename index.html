                    Survivorship bias, survival bias or immortal time bias is the logical error 
                    of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process 
                    and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. 
                    This can lead to some false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of
                    selection bias. Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because 
                    failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from
                    analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the 
                    successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence 
                    (correlation "proves" causality). For example, if three of the five students with 
                    the best college grades went to the same high school, that can lead one to believe 
                    that the high school must offer an excellent education when, in fact, it may be just 
                    a much larger school instead. This can be better understood by looking at the grades 
                    of all the other students from that high school, not just the ones who made the 
                    top-five selection process. Another kind of survivorship bias would involve thinking 
                    that an incident was not all that dangerous because everyone communicated with 
                    afterwards survived. Even if one knew that some people are dead, they would not have 
                    their voice to add to the conversation, leading to bias in the conversation.

                <h3>The 3 truth-in-advertising problems that it generates</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The advertisement either fails to disclose the existence of relevant 
                        differences between the two populations or describes them in insufficient detail;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These differences result from the company's deliberate "pre-screening" of 
                        prospective customers to ensure that only customers with traits increasing their 
                        likelihood of success are allowed to purchase the product or service, especially 
                        when the company's selection procedures or evaluation standards are kept secret;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The company offering the product or service charges a fee, especially one that 
                        is non-refundable or not disclosed in the advertisement, for the privilege of 
                        attempting to become a customer.
                    </li>
                </ol>
